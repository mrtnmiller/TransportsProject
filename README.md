# Logistic Transports Project

### Creating, populating, updating database & performing basic analysis on it in MySQL

This is a simple project to show that relational databases can be and should be used on a small-scale business level too. I have personal insight into international logistics due to my previous work experience but this dataset contains purely fictional data about a small company's exports in a month.

The project involves:

- Creating a database using SQL DDL
- Creating and populating 4 tables using SQL DDL and DML
- Establishing the connection between the tables making the database relational (RDB)
- Performing sorting, filtering, calculations and joins
- Querying the database using SQL DQL to create a CSV file for reporting in Google Sheets which can be viewed here: https://bit.ly/3yAYivT

Here is an overview of the database:

The code was written in standard SQL using MySQL syntax, therefore it is recommended to run it in a similar environment otherwise apply the necessary changes.
